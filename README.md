# raya-hi.github.io

Just an idle thought that came to mind when my better half asked
if it would be possible to make a celebratory pix for raya to
send to friends. As I didn't have enough time to make a decent one,
I figured I may as well try to whip up something quick for her.

In short, it's a bit of a html/css/bootstrap exercise for me also.

Pictures used for the bg is one sent to be my a family member (if I'm
not mistaken). The pictures in the carousel are from a series of freely
obtainable printable greeting cards from Brother's Creative Center. Link
is in the credits in the footer.

Feel free to share this hastily whipped up site. Thank you :-
